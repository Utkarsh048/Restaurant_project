# Restaurant_project
A fully operational and responsive restaurant website

Here, I have made a  restaurant website project, meticulously designed with HTML, CSS, JS, and SVG files for a seamless and visually appealing experience. The HTML ensures organized content, CSS styling offers a responsive and pleasing design, while JavaScript adds dynamic interactivity. SVG files contribute to creative graphics and icons, providing a modern and engaging interface. Discover our menu, ambiance, and make reservations effortlessly, as this project harmoniously blends technology with culinary artistry for an immersive digital dining experience.
